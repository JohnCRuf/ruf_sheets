\section{Normal Form Games}
\subsection{Definitions}
Normal form games take on the same definition introduced initially:
\begin{align*}
    G=(N,A,\succeq)
\end{align*}
Where players are denoted by N, actions are denoted of A, and preferences are rational on A for every player in N.
\subsection{Solution Concepts and Nash Equilibrium}
The best response correspondance for player i is given by:
\begin{align*}
    B_i: A_{-i} &\rightarrow 2^{A_i} \\
    B_i: a_{-i} &\rightarrow \{ a_i | \text{$a_i$ is a BR to $a_{-i}$}\} \\
\end{align*}
A Nash equilibrium of G is an $a \in A$ s.t. $a_i \in B_i(a_{-i})\,\forall i$.
\subsection{Mixed Strategy Games}
A game with mixed strategies is a tuple
\[\left(N,\, \left\{A_i\right\}_{i \in N},\, \left\{\succsim\right\}_{i \in N}\right),\]
where player \(i\)'s actions are mixed strategies in \(\Delta(A_i)\) (lotteries over \(A_i\)) and \(\succsim_i\) is defined over \(\Delta(A_i)\) and are expected utility preferences.

For a game \(G = \left(N,\, A,\, \succsim\right)\), the game with mixed strategies
\[\Tilde{G} = \left(N,\, \Tilde{A},\, \Tilde{\succsim}\right)\]
is a mixed extension if \(\Tilde{A}_i = A_i\) and if \(\succsim\) and \(\Tilde{\succsim}\) give the same ranking on pure actions.

\textbf{Best Responses: Definition} 
A mixed strategy profile \(\alpha_i\) is a best response to \(\alpha_{-i}\) if
\[u_i(\alpha_i,\,\alpha_{-i}) \geq u_i(\alpha_i',\,\alpha_{-i}),\,\, \forall\alpha_i'.\]\\
\textbf{Best Responses: Proposition} Fix a game with mixed strategies and a mixed strategy profile \(\alpha\). Then, \(\alpha_i\) is a best response to \(\alpha_{-i}\) if and only if \(a_i\) is a best response to \(\alpha_{-i}\) for all \(a_i\) such that \(\alpha(a_i) > 0\).
