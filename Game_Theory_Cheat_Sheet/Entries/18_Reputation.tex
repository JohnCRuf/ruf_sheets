\subsection{Chain Store Game Set-up}
In the Chain Store game, \(K\) entrants decide sequentially whether to enter; one incumbent chooses to fight or acquiesce. Full history is observable. Incumbent prefers no entry $>$ acquiesce $>$ fight; entrant enters iff incumbent acquiesces.

Backward induction: $(\mathrm{In},\,\mathrm{A})$ at all steps.

\subsection{Incumbent Types}
Two types: normal (as above), aggressive (prefers fighting). Incumbent is aggressive w.p.\ $\epsilon > 0$. Now there is no SE where entrant always enters: if incumbent fights, posterior probability of aggressive type rises, deterring later entrants.

\subsection{Incumbent Minimum Payoff Theorem}
In any SE of the Chain Store game with $K$ entrants, the incumbent's payoff $\geq 3(K + \log_2(2\epsilon))$.

\textbf{Key idea:} Normal type can deviate to always fighting (mimicking aggressive type). After $k$ rounds of $(\mathrm{In}, \mathrm{F})$, posterior $\epsilon(h) \geq 2^k \epsilon$, so entrants are deterred after $\leq -\log_2(2\epsilon)$ fights.

\subsection{Folk Theorem (Repeated Games)}
Let \(G^\infty(\delta)\) be the infinitely repeated game with discount \(\delta\). A payoff \(v\) is \textbf{individually rational} if \(v_i \geq \min_{a_{-i}}\max_{a_i} u_i\) for all \(i\), and \textbf{feasible} if \(v \in \mathrm{conv}(u(A))\). \textbf{Folk Thm:} Every feasible, individually rational \(v\) is an SPE payoff of \(G^\infty(\delta)\) for \(\delta\) sufficiently close to~1.
