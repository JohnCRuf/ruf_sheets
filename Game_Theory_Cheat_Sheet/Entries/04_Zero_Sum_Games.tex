\section{Lecture 4: Zero Sum Games \& Maxmin}
\subsection{Max-min Soln. Definition} 
Given a game, the maxmin solution for player \(i\) is the set of solutions to
\[\max_{a_i \in A_i}\min_{a_{-i} \in A_{-i}}u_i(a_i,\,a_{-i}).\]
\subsection{TPZSG And Maxmin} 
Fix a two-player zero-sum game \(\left(A_1,\, A_2,\, u_1\right)\). Suppose a maxmin solution exists for both players, with payoffs \(v_1^*\) and \(v_2^*\). Then, 
\[v_1^* \leq -v_2^*.\]
\subsection{Duality Gap Definition}
The \textbf{duality gap} of a two-player zero-sum game is \(v_1^* + v_2^*\) (\(\leq 0\)).

\subsection{Duality Gap and Nash Equilibria} The duality gap is zero if and only if a Nash equilibrium exists. If the duality gap is zero, then the set of Nash equilibria are precisely the maxmin solutions for each player.
\section{Minimax}
If \(G\) is a two-player zero-sum game with finite pure actions and mixed strategies, then the game has a value; i,e, the maxmin solution exists and the duality gap is zero.
\subsection{TPZS, values, and Nash equilibria}
Every symmetric, two-player zero-sum game with mixed strategies has a value; i.e. it has a Nash equilibrium and \(v_1^* = -v_2^*\).
\subsection{Farkas' Lemma}
Given \(A \in \R^{m \cross n}\) and \(b \in \R^m\), exactly one of the following holds:
\begin{enumerate}[label = (\roman*)]
    \item \(\exists\,x \in \R^n\) such that \(Ax = b\) and \(x \geq 0\)
    \item \(\exists\,y \in \R^m\) such that \(yA \geq 0\) and \(yb < 0\)
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Farkas' Lemma: HW Variants}
One variant (covered in problem set 4) is as follows: given \(A \in \R^{m \cross n}\) and \(b \in \R^m\), exactly one of the following holds:
\begin{enumerate}[label = (\roman*)]
    \item \(\exists\,x \in \R^n\) such that \(Ax \leq b\)
    \item \(\exists\,y \in \R^m\) such that \(yA = 0\), \(y \geq 0\), and \(yb < 0\)
\end{enumerate}

Finally, an equivalent statement known as Gordan's Lemma gives the following two mutually exclusive possibilities for \(A\) and \(b\):
\begin{enumerate}[label = (\roman*)]
    \item \(\exists\,x \in \R^n\) such that \(Ax < 0\)
    \item \(\exists\,y \in \R^m\) such that \(yA = 0\) with \(y \geq 0\) and \(y_i > 0\) for some \(i\).
\end{enumerate}
