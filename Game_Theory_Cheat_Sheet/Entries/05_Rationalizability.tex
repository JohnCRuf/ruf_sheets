\subsection{Strict Dominance: Definition}
\textbf{Strictly Dominated}
Given a game w/ mixed strategies, $\alpha_i \in \Delta(A_i)$ is strictly dominated if $\exists \alpha_i'\in \Delta(A_i)$ s.t $\forall a_{-i}$, $U_i(\alpha_i',a_{-i})>U_i(\alpha_i,a_{-i})$. Note: This is the same as if we said $\forall \alpha_{-i}$.
\textbf{Strictly Dominant}
An action $\alpha_i$ is strictly dominant if $\forall \alpha_i' \neq \alpha_i$, $\alpha_i'$ is strictly dominated by $\alpha_i$
\subsection{Never-Best Responses: Definition}
A never best response is an action $\alpha_i \in \Delta(A_i)$ such that there does a not exist a mixed strategy $\alpha_j \in  \Delta(A_i)$ such that $a_i \in B_i(\alpha)$. \\

An set based definition is s follows: \\
Given a product set of actions $\Tilde{A}= \Pi_{i=1}^N \Tilde{A}_i$, $\Tilde{A_i} \subseteq A_i$, $N_i(\Tilde{A})=\{a_i \in A_i | \neg \exists \mu \in \Delta(\Tilde{A}_{-i})$ s.t. $a_i \in B_i(\mu)\}$
\subsection{NBR and SD Correspondence Proposition}
The key proposition for Strict Dominance and NBR is their direct correspondence. \\

Proposition: \\

$\alpha_i$ is strictly dominated IFF $\alpha_i$ is not a best reply for any $\mu \in \Delta(A_{-i})$ or $\alpha_i \neg \in B_i(\mu) \forall \mu$. \\

NOTE: This definition includes correlated equilibrium. $a_{-i}$ can be correlated but $a_i$ is independent of $a_{-i}$. 

\subsection{Deletion Sequence Definition}
A deletion sequence is a sequence of product sets of action profiles \(\left\{A^k\right\}_{k=0}^K\), with \(K\) either finite or infinite, such that

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \(A_i^0 = A_i\) (the set of all actions),
    \item \(A^{k+1} \subsetneq A^k\) for all \(k < K\)
    \item \(A_i^k - A_i^{k+1} \subseteq N_i(A^k)\) for all \(i\) and all \(k < K\)
    \item \(N_i(A^\infty) \cap A_i = \emptyset\), where \(A_i^\infty = \bigcap_{k \geq 0} A_i^k\)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Greedy Deletion Sequence}
The greedy deletion sequence is \(A_i^0 = A_i\), and \(A_i^k = A_i^{k-1} - N_i(A_i^{k-1})\).

\subsection{Rationalizability Theorem}
Suppose $G=(N,A,u)$ is a finite game with mixed strategies, then $\exists$ a prod set $A^* \neq \emptyset$ s.t. for every deletion sequence $\{A^k\}$, $A^* \cap_{u \geq 0} A^k$
\subsection{Hammer Lemma}
For any finite game with mixed strategy, player \(i\)'s best response correspondence is nonempty for any strategy profile \(\mu \in \Delta(A_{-i})\); that is, \(B_i(\mu) \neq \emptyset\).

\subsection{Smiley Lemma}
$N_i(\Tilde{A})$ is decreasing in $\Tilde{A}$, ie, if $\Tilde{A} \subseteq \Tilde{A}'$ then $N_i(\Tilde{A}') \subseteq N_i(\Tilde{A})$
\subsection{Rainbow Lemma}
Every seq $\{A^k\}$ satisfying 1-3 definitions of a deletion sequence has finite length. 
\subsection{Star Lemma}
The limit of any deletion sequence is non-empty. 
\subsection{Best Reply Property}
A product set has the best reply property if $\forall i$ and $a_i \in \Tilde{A}_i$, $\exists \mu \in  \Delta (\Tilde{A}_{-i})$ s.t. $a_i \in B_i(\mu)$. \\

An equivalent definition is as follows: \\

$N_i(\Tilde{A}) \cap \Tilde{A}_i=\emptyset \forall i$. \\

Corollary: \\

If $\Tilde{A}$ then that set has the best reply property.
\subsection{Swirl Lemma}
If a product set $\Tilde{A}$ has the best response property, then $\Tilde{A} \subseteq \Tilde{A'}$ for any $\Tilde{A'}$ that survives iterated deletion.
